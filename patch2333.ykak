/startupdate find` is not a standard command or function found in widely used operating systems or software applications.  Therefore, it doesn't have a Wikipedia-style entry.  The command appears to be a custom or program-specific instruction, possibly within a proprietary system or a scripting language.  Without more context regarding its source (e.g., the software or application where it is used), a detailed explanation is impossible.  The individual components suggest potential actions: `/startupdate` might initiate an update process, and `find` might specify a search or selection criterion within that update process.  However, this interpretation is purely speculative without further information.
